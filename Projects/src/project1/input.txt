This is an input file for project 1 in CSCI 212, Fall 2022 semester.
The basic idea of this project is to read lines from
a file, and count the number of vowels that appear on
all the lines.
The actual description of the project is:

Write a main application called Project1.java, and a GUI (that extends JFrame) 
called VowelGUI.java. The main program should open a file called
“input.txt” which will contain a paragraph.

Read the lines from the file until there are no more.
For each line, count the number of individual vowels in that line,
using a counter for the vowels ‘A’ and ‘a’, a counter 
for the vowels ‘E’ and ‘e’, and so forth.

The GUI should have a grid layout of one row 
and two columns (column 0 and 1). Column 0 should
contain the original text from the file. Column 1 should contain
5 lines displaying the count of each of the vowels.
